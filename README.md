This [jupyter notebook ](https://github.com/MartinWalchshofer/EEG-Signal-Quality/blob/main/EEGSignalQuality.ipynb) shows how to evaluate the EEG signal quality by applying some default signal processing.<br/><br/>
Data for this example was recorder using a 'Unicorn Hybrid Black' in combination with 'Unicorn Recorder'. The raw data was stored in a CSV file.
